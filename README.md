BRIEF DESCRIPTION

	Captain's log is a site that allows users to log trips and explore others. 
	The Explore page offers users the ability to search trips depending on the search-terms they enter.
	The Profile page is where users are able to log a trip and view a stream of their trips. On the left is the 
	user-info including a profile pic and a bio. On the right is a stream of trips they have looged.
	The "My Map" page shows a map with markers for each place the user has logged a trip.

	posts and maps.
	I’m Alex and I want to have a map with markers for the trips I’ve gone on.
	I’m Amanda and I’d like to look at other users’ trips to help me plan mine for the future.

WISHLIST/FUTURE DEVELOPMENT

	From the function perspective, it would be great to let users update posts-- as they can only delete them as of now.
	Adding comments is another feature I plan on adding.
	I'd also like to give users the ability to follow other users.
	From a user experience perspective there is a lot I'd like to change. The search feature on the Explore 
	page should be the most prominant feature.
